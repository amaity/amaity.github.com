                <h2>Indian Paintings - A Short History</h2>
                <h5>Disclaimer: This is a loose translation of the work <i>Bharater Chitrakala</i> by <i>Sri Ashoke Mitra</i>. No 
                    originality or credit is intended nor claimed for this piece.</h5>
                <h4><b>Introduction</b></h4>
                <p>In our country, it is not easy to view paintings as we desire. Most of the major paintings are in foreign hands; 
                    what little is available here are mostly in the collections of the rich and with the families of earstwhile kings. 
                    The only complete intact paintings are those located in caves which cannot be relocated. No library in 
                    our country has complete references on indigenous and foreign paintings. The kind of books required to understand
                    the history, trade, economy and politics that influenced the paintings are also not available. Thus a student of
                    art is often disoriented in her pursuit to understand such works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To learn about and understand paintings, one needs to view them. A  particular work of an artist is not self-contained 
                    nor complete in itself. That work is one among the many others created by the artist. Trying to understand an
                    artist without viewing or studying her other works is therefore futile. That artist has worked in particular 
                    country, over a particular time period in a particular historical, social and political enviornment. But it would
                    be wrong to interpret an artist based on that particular country, time period and environment. Every country, era
                    and environment has a past. To understand the past, one therefore needs to know and understand many countries 
                    and many ages. Moreover, it is not enough to study one art form. It is necessary to know and understand all associated art
                    forms of that country, its science and history. When the evolution of art over various periods in the whole world
                    is discussed, we can reach a simple conclusion. Many eras or great geographical distances notwithstanding 
                    the paintings of various cultures reveal an unity that is astonishingly coincidental.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason for this is not some all conquering autogenous talent. Even that grows with the help of several things.
                    Especially, the art world has no boundaries of time and place. The art of one country drawns incessantly from the
                    art of another country and era. It learns and acquires and creates something fundamental thereby repaying its debt.
                    In addition, its most important attribute is to remain established in a particular country, era and time. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Moreover, just as a language inspite of being the common property of a race, is not pleasing to hear nor is its 
                    character apparent until it is spoken by some particular individual in her own unique style and cadence, similarly
                    the language of art though universal does not convey its majesty till it includes within itself the different
                    characteristics of a race, a nation, a society.
                </p>
                
                <h4><b>The Earliest Painting</b></h4>
                <p>
                    Drawing is a natural tendency whatever be its form. This habit is sometimes apparent at an early 
                    age and must have similarly been evident in the early ages of human history. There are plenty of studies
                    to ascertain the reason behind this habit yet it is a fact that many ages ago, even before Asansol,
                    Ranigunj, Birbhum, Bankura were buried below mountains of snow, even before that, when pre-historic
                    humans ate raw meat because they did not know how to light a fire, they could and did draw in caves.
                    What compelled them to draw is not known. The astonishing thing is that those drawings had such 
                    attributes as cannot be ignored by artists even today. The simple and bold lines of the drawings 
                    and their emotional appeal are still sought after by artists.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It may be surprising to know that there are atleast twenty-seven big and small places all over India
                    that have paintings on the walls of a cave or cluster of caves that archaeologists believe date back
                    to the Stone age. Much later, after thousands of years came our historical era which is not more than
                    three to four thousand years old. Humans lived in caves even in this era as some do even now.
