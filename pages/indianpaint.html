                <h2>Indian Paintings - A Short History</h2>
                <h3><b>Disclaimer: This is a loose translation of the work <i>Bharater Chitrakala</i> by <i>Sri Ashoke Mitra</i>. No

                <p>In our country, it's not easy to view paintings as we desire. Most of the major paintings are in foreign hands, 
                    what little is available here are mostly in the collection of the rich and with the families of earstwhile kings 
                    The only complete intact paintings are those located in caves which cannot be relocated. No library in 
                    our country has complete references on indigenous and foreign paintings. The kind of books required to understand
                    the history, trade, economy and politics that influenced the paintings are also not available. Thus a student of
                    art is often disoriented in her pursuit to understand such works.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To learn about and understand paintings, one needs to view them. A  particular work of an artist is not self-contained 
                    nor complete in itself. That work is one among the many others created by the artist. Trying to understand an
                    artist without viewing or studying her other works is therefore futile. That artist has worked in particular 
                    country, over a particular time period in a particular historical, social and political enviornment.
